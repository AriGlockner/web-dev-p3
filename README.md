<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>For this project, I created a web application that displays MLB player statistics. The application fetches player data from a REST API and displays it in a table. The table is sortable by each column, and the data is updated dynamically when the user clicks on a column header.</p>
<p>I chose to create this project because I love playing Fantasy Baseball and I want to get an advantage over my opponents. I focused on getting data on batters because I am much better at finding pitchers than hitters. I focused on expected statistics because I want to be able to see who is over-performing and under-performing so that I can buy low or sell high on players and win my trades.</p>
